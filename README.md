# Fire-Incident-Data-Analysis and How we can overcome with overfiting

This project focuses on analyzing fire incident data to uncover meaningful insights and trends, 
after doing prediction by using linear regression, I find out some thing called overfiting, loss function R2 SCORE is very high so by using which model i can overcome 
## Project Overview
- Cleaned and preprocessed fire-related data.
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand incident patterns.
- Visualized key factors influencing fire incidents.
- Implementing Ridge, Lasso and Elastic net regression 
- Prepared dataset for further modeling or reporting.

## Project Structure
- fire_cleaned.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis steps.

## Key Steps
- ## Feature Scaling or Standardization
- ## BOX PLOT TO UNDERSTAND EFFECT OF STANDFARD SCALER
- ## Lasso Regression
- ## RIDGE REGRESSION
- ## ELASTIC NET


## How to Run
1. Install required packages (if not already installed):
    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
    ```
2. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
